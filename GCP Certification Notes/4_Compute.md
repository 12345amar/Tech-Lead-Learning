# Compute Services

## Key Services
- **Compute Engine (GCE)** → VMs
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** → Managed K8s
- **App Engine** → PaaS (standard & flexible)
- **Cloud Run** → Serverless containers

## Exam Tips
- Preemptible VMs = cheap, short-lived.
- Use Managed Instance Groups for autoscaling.
- App Engine standard has free quota, flexible supports custom runtimes.
- Cloud Run = stateless, HTTP-triggered containers.
